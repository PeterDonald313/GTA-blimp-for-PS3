# GTA-blimp-for-PS3
Do you hate how Rockstar made you get the premium version or pre order release for GTA V for PS3 to let you fly the blimp? Look no further

So basicly all this is a .pkg you can install that adds the blimp contact to your phone and alows you to hop in it if you want a hijack a blimp an npc is flying
